# 1D OT Example 

The notebook sets up  a discretized 1D optimal [transport problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics) using a basis function approach.  We express the dual optimization variables $(\phi, \psi)$ as combinations of nonlinear basis functions before applying an [SCS, or Splitting Conic](https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/) solver.   
We hope to generalize and/or optimize solutions.
